## For developers

### Quickstart

If your device is clean (such as a fresh cloud VM) you can use this
script for an automated setup:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
./setup.sh
```

Otherwise, proceed with the full instructions below.

### Manual setup

Install system dependencies:

Linux:
```
sudo apt install cmake pkg-config libssl-dev git clang libclang-dev
```

Mac:
```
brew install cmake pkg-config openssl git llvm
```

Install Edgeware dependencies:

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
rustup update stable
rustup update nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
cargo install --git https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasm-gc
```

Initialize Submodules
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Build Edgeware:

```
cargo build --release
```

Ensure you have a fresh start if updating from another version:
```
./scripts/purge-chain.sh beresheet
```

To start up the Edgeware node and connect to the Beresheet testnet, run:
```
./target/release/edgeware --chain=beresheet --name <INSERT_NAME>
```
